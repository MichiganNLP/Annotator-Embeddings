# example-data
This repo includes processing script we have for the each dataset we included
in [TID-8 datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dnaihao/TID-8).

Note that here we explicitly include the annotations one annotator has on 
other examples to help the later modeling process. But in [TID-8 datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dnaihao/TID-8), such information
is omitted for simplicity.

If you want to use a cleaned version of these datasets, you may go to [TID-8 datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dnaihao/TID-8) directly.

Otherwise, you may download each dataset and rename and process them accordingly.
